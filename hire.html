<h1 id="b2b-saas-owners-lets-build-better-without-burning-out.-1">B2B SaaS owners, let's <em>build better without burning out.</em></h1>
<p>I build B2B SaaS <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> products and engineering systems. I strive to <em>build better without burning out</em>. To that end, I hold these things dear.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Culture.</em> Foster a <a href="./posts/people-culture-values-strategy-technology/index.html#main">generative culture</a> that yields elite outcomes.</li>

<p>If challenges around these rob you of opportunity, progress, and sleep, I am available to help, through one of these initiatives.</p>
<h2 id="deploy-writing-strategically.">Deploy writing strategically.</h2>
<p>Good writing habits can transform the 1x product engineering team into the proverbial 10x team <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Yet few teams <em>choose</em> to build a solid culture of writing <em>and reading</em>. Their people toil on hamster wheels of endless forgetting and rework. Sad. We can do better.</p>
<h2 id="advance-product-engineering-maturity.">Advance product engineering maturity.</h2>
<p>Hiring more people makes late projects later. Death marches burn away minds and bodies. Mass layoffs destroy capital.</p>
<p>Intelligent professional coaching, teaching, and on-boarding is how teams get <em>very</em> good, stay lean, attract and retain the right kind of people, and make big things happen.</p>
<p>Let's bet on our people.</p>
<h2 id="you-sherlock-i-watson.-we-founders-second-brain.">You Sherlock, I Watson. We, founder's second brain.</h2>
<p>You are the Sherlock of your business. You live by your wits, sleuthing your way through vexing mysteries the world throws at you.</p>
<p>Might a Watson help you <em>eval/apply</em> better?</p>
<p>You see, Watson is <em>not</em> Sherlock's guru, boss, equal, or competitor. Certainly not their lackey. Watson is a smart, independent, resourceful soul whom Sherlock chooses to retain because the two are far greater than the one.</p>
<p>Tech-savvy product owner, meet business-savvy engineer. Hi!</p>
<h1 id="working-together">Working together</h1>
<p>Currently I engage formally on an advisory retainer basis only. Spots are very limited. I also maintain informal office hours to chat about any of the above topics. I would love to hear what's on your mind. Please write to me at <a href="mailto:aditya@evalapply.org">aditya@evalapply.org</a> with your thoughts and any questions. I will be happy to exchange ideas and perhaps get on a call if things get super interesting.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Dots only connect in reverse. Over the last 15 years or so, I happened to market, sell, co-found, product manage, test, operate, code hire for, learn, use, teach software things. SaaS, mostly B2B, has been a core thread through all of that career vagabonding. Now, that is my wheelhouse!<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>10x implies the fact of great leverage, not the degree of it. I believe the proverbial 10x developer is that good <em>because</em> they habitually "write the thing down". I know it makes me better and I know others have profited from stuff I wrote down. Frequently years down the line. Writing is core to my process, especially as a soloist. Decision records, concept notes, checklists and runbooks, guides and tutorials, bug reports, commit messages, reviews and critiques, product documentation, blog posts, brain dump notes; I use them all judiciously in my own work.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
