Also, while the *problem* focuses on "design in the small" of application logic, many ideas in the *solution* can—and do—scale all the way to "design in the large" of whole systems.</description></item><item><title>Which Clojure codebases should I read?

I struggled a lot with the question too, when starting off in Clojureland. Here are my notes and opinions.</description></item><item><title>Why and How I use "Org Mode" for my writing and more</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/why-and-how-i-use-org-mode/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/why-and-how-i-use-org-mode/</guid><description>I find myself telling people that they will have to pry org-mode from my cold dead hands. Which befuddles me. Why, as an ingrate software nerd who has soured on software technology — talk about biting the hand that feeds — do I evince such strong sentiment about a software program?!</description></item><item><title>Shell ain't a bad place to FP: part 1/N: McIlroy's Pipeline</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/shell-aint-a-bad-place-to-fp-part-1-doug-mcilroys-pipeline/index.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/shell-aint-a-bad-place-to-fp-part-1-doug-mcilroys-pipeline/</guid><description>Or, the one in which we "take apart" Douglas McIlroy's pipeline from 1986. Doing so teaches an object lesson about the essence of modular, composable, functional architecture.</description></item><item><title>shite: static sites from shell (part 1/2) — feeling the html.energy</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/shite-the-static-sites-from-shell-part-1/index.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/shite-the-static-sites-from-shell-part-1/</guid><description>This primer is for people like me, who long dreamed of lovingly hand-crafting our own home on the Internet.

How does code look in the two languages I like a lot; Clojure and APL?</description></item><item><title>Shell ain't a bad place to FP: part 0/N: Introduction</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/shell-aint-a-bad-place-to-fp-part-0-intro/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/shell-aint-a-bad-place-to-fp-part-0-intro/</guid><description>Or, *Supremely Functional Bash Programming*, an exploration in N parts...</description></item><item><title>Baby don't hurry, don't stop (feat.

People struggle forward through crazy marketplace and environmental complexities just to get from one day to the other. Yet I can't shake off the feeling that we make it harder for ourselves than it should be. I've been trying to work out why. There's a lot to unpack. This post is a start at thinking about it in public.</description></item><item><title>In the beginning, was the domain name</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/hello-world/index.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>How this blog came to be is a minor miracle.
