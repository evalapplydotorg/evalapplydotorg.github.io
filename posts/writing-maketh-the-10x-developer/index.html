      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I think the proverbial 10x developer is real <em>and</em> I think they are that good <em>because</em> they habitually <em>"write the thing down"</em>. Which makes them better thinkers. Which clarity of mind betters not only their odds of solving known problems better and faster, but also their odds of unearthing the right <em>unknown</em> problems better and faster. Further, they influence people around them to become reliably better, be it by direct mentoring, osmosis, or bar setting. Small reliable improvements compound. That is how they 10x. I, for one, am <a href="../index.html">on it</a> and I am <a href="../../hire.html#deploy-writing-strategically.">game to help</a>.</p>

<p><strong>LR:</strong> Grab a coffee…</p>
<p>As a software developer, it <em>bothers</em> me when developers disdain writing.</p>
<p>Somehow, our tribe manages to simultaneously deify banging out reams of code and scorn deliberate, long form reasoning. Perhaps we believe that fetching more coin for one's work than another confers natural superiority over them. And since all of one's writer friends must bartend or babysit or ghostwrite or self loathe while feeding SEO machines just to feed themselves, "writing words" must be low value and low status. The Efficient Market cannot possibly have made such a gobsmacking boondoggle, right? … Right? <a href="#fn1" target="_self" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Bloody hell. <em>Writing powers our entire modern civilization.</em> <a href="#fn2" target="_self" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>You and I are here because of it. We are software <em>authors</em>. Writing <em>is</em> what we do. Great writing we admire is stunningly difficult because it requires <em>at least</em> the same intensity of mental effort, abstract creativity, and intellectual discipline sustained over long periods of time; months and years <a href="#fn3" target="_self" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Do we fail to see it because it is blindingly obvious?</p>
<p>Anyway, we don't have to be so high falutin'. We can just look around and think for ourselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Det. Roland 'Prez' Pryzbylewski:<br />
"Failure to properly identify myself as a police officer." Sounds like what I was guilty of most of my career, actually.</p>
<p>— The Wire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the solo extreme of the spectrum, consider legendary individuals like, say, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan <a href="#fn4" target="_self" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Consider the legions of C programmers that learned at their feet, using <em>The C Programming Language</em> book (first edition, 1978). Consider the great C programmers who came after them and authored great C programs — severally by themselves — cURL, SSH, ffmpeg, Linux, SQLite to name just a few. You see, C became great not <em>only</em> because it was revolutionary, or benefited from great timing. It became great because <em>Archmages</em> taught how to wield it, by writing with clarity. Even if their book lightly influenced just one of the other great software authors, K&amp;R would each be <em>One Million</em> x developers, by way of the value unlocked by that <em>developer advocacy</em>, to use today's in term. Even at that colossal magnitude of writing-powered leverage, they are not alone by a long shot. If you can think up other writerly developers with like impact, you may grudgingly agree that a bit of hyperbole isn't unwarranted.</p>
<p>Somewhere across the spectrum, toward somewhat larger groups of people, consider popular acquisitions like Whatsapp, Instagram, YouTube etc. Kings' ransoms paid to acquire things built, scaled, and operated by absurdly small engineering teams. Things that have gone on to repay their purchase prices many times over <a href="#fn5" target="_self" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Software <em>is</em> extreme leverage.</p>
<p>Now, a team of developers is a finickier beast than a lone one. The larger the headcount, the easier it is to play Chinese Whispers, and the faster it is to get worse-er. Which is to say, communicating <em>very</em> well with each other becomes mission-critical (if you <em>want</em> to perform at an elite level, of course).</p>
<p>I will bet good money that those unicorn teams that exited for tens of millions of dollars of valuation per developer weren't A-teams merely because they were full of A-players. They were so highly leveraged by dint of being A-grade <em>written</em> communicators.</p>
<p>Well, actually I don't need to bet. Someone already bet big for us.</p>
<p>At the behemoth end of the spectrum, if my six-page narrative memo helps convince my CEO to fund the multi-billion dollar cloud computing project, the memo alone is worth my weight in gold, to my career. I'm not saying <em>"Copy Bezos."</em>. I'm saying notice that Bezos understood the incredible value of hard-coding common sense writing practices into the organisational fabric. Similarly, lore of the <em>"BillG Review"</em> is semi-known <a href="#fn6" target="_self" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. And I've heard of "<em>Jerry Yang Reviews</em>" that some veteran <em>Yahoo!</em> s may recount.</p>
<p>I contend these are <em>not</em> random anomalies, merely ones that got popular press coverage. Trust me not… root about the woodwork and you'll see for yourself; the ones and twos, the squads, the giants.</p>

<p>That said, mere mortal developers, like Yours Truly, may aspire to such towering international brilliance only at great peril. Not gonna happen, yo. <em>That</em> said, I believe we <em>can</em> aspire to be 10x better than we are today.</p>
<p><em>"How?"</em> is an open secret… Learning to write — and therefore think — with clarity is how we get there.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, there is good news and bad news. Luckily, also some relieving news.</p>
<p><em><strong>The good news?</strong></em></p>
<p>We have it <em>easy</em> compared to <em>actual</em> writers.</p>
<p>For us, is <em>not</em> about becoming literature majors, and holding down a software job to feed ourselves while we try to get published. For us, the writing is about putting common sense stuff down in a centrally searchable database (a wiki). We can forgo grammar and lyrical prose <a href="#fn7" target="_self" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> as long as we at least write structured outlines, using simple phrases and headlines and bullet points and tables and suchlike. It need not be compelling, merely useful. <em>Also</em> writing like a writer is a nice cherry on top. By the way, it is easy to notice that very good developers are frequently very good writers too. Vice-versa, I believe good writers can train to be good developers. The mental wiring is very similar.</p>
<p><em><strong>The bad news?</strong></em></p>
<p>There are no silver bullets.</p>
<p>Writing is unnatural, especially for teams. Remember Bezos? Well, even someone with his smarts, charisma, and sweeping authority over his company had to work to make it work…</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>It is a conscious choice.</strong></em> We have to culture ourselves into pervasive, thoughtful, effective engineering writing not just individually, but as teams and whole org charts. LLMs may make writing life easier, but only we can do the work to make it work.</li>
<li><em><strong>It is not a one off activity.</strong></em> Our kind of writing remains useful only through repeat use and progressive revision <em>throughout the life of a software</em>.</li>
<li><em><strong>It requires widespread buy-in.</strong></em> One can't force it. Doing so will reliably cause more damage than good, by violently convincing people that it sucks, because the experience of it will in fact suck for everyone involved. If you find yourself in a leadership position in a writing-averse culture, boy do you have your work cut out. How will you save your people from the septic floodwaters of Meeting Overflow?</li>
<li><em><strong>It is not a template.</strong></em> For example, if you try to copy Bezos and some imagined "Amazon Way", you will <em>at best</em> create a poor facsimile, which will only degrade over time. Just like those who tried and failed and still do, to recreate the <em>Toyota Way</em>. Many are seduced by the allure of their Zen-like philosophy, lofty principles, and relentless success. Few notice how deep their writing practice goes, and how central it is to the ongoing success of their <em>Way</em>. So draw inspiration by all means, but work intelligently with your own context.</li>
<li><em><strong>It will reveal -your- nature and values.</strong></em> If you fear that you might create a nightmare bureaucracy of soul-sucking process documentation and inter-personnel file redirection, you may need to stop right now and do some heavy soul-searching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe some more great points that elude my mind. But you catch the drift, yes? Ain't no silver bullet.</p>
<p><em><strong>The relieving news?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is not an all-or-nothing deal. We can be gradual. We can start small. Even one person is enough to begin with.</p>
<p>We can learn and apply "developerly writing" <a href="#fn8" target="_self" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> in a series of wee progressions, apt for the local context. Each progression can be made to systematically compose with the ones that came before, such that composition compounds value. Sustained compounding delivers integer multiplication.</p>
<p>With some perseverance, smart tooling, and some luck (fortune favours the prepared), we <em>can</em> become the 10x version of ourselves.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>So far, The Market, though arguably more humane than monarchs or central planners, appears to have become better at giving society what <em>some</em> people <em>desire</em>, rather than what <em>all</em> people <em>need</em>. The distribution of access to clean air, water, shelter, and a full belly come to mind. Yes, hundreds of millions of us enjoy services and conveniences available only to nobility of the past. Yes, the wretched of society are marginally better off today than up to the early 1900s, staying abreast of shifting poverty lines. Yes, the literate vastly outnumber the illiterate, a sea change. Yet, society at large appears to be worse for the wear and heading for a Really Bad Time. Even so, I remain optimistic that human ingenuity and compassion will prevail, in my own lifetime. We will not yet fail our solitary pale blue dot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is really incredible the amount of pushback I see from companies, startups to big, about writing. In particular around the notion that writing is the antithesis of agile. Writing ossifies and cements decision or plans that should change, it is said. My view is that agility comes from planning. Without plans, activities are just brownian motion. And you can’t have plans, especially shared plans, without writing.</p>
