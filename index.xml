  <title>Which Clojure codebases should I read? How and why?</title>

  <description>Newcomers to Clojure so frequently ask this question that an FAQ/Guide is being discussed, to add to the Clojure website. I struggled a lot with the question too, when starting off in Clojureland. Here are my notes and opinions.</description>

  <title>Why and How I use "Org Mode" for my writing and more</title>
  <link>https://evalapply.org/posts/why-and-how-i-use-org-mode/index.html</link>

  <guid>https://evalapply.org/posts/why-and-how-i-use-org-mode/</guid>
  <description>I find myself telling people that they will have to pry org-mode from my cold dead hands. Which befuddles me. Why, as an ingrate software nerd who has soured on software technology — talk about biting the hand that feeds — do I evince such strong sentiment about a software program?!</description>

  <title>n ways to FizzBuzz in Clojure</title>

  <description>FizzBuzz is everywhere. Every programmer passes through its rite of passage, or at least bears witness to another. Over the years, many gentlenerds have taken it upon themselves to discover ever new ways to incant those hoary symbols. I hereby enjoin these few drops of Clojure to that roiling ocean of FizzBuzzery.</description>

  <title>Shell ain't a bad place to FP: part 1/N: McIlroy's Pipeline</title>

  <description>Or, the one in which we "take apart" Douglas McIlroy's pipeline from 1986. Doing so teaches an object lesson about the essence of modular, composable, functional architecture.</description>

  <description>This primer is for people like me, who long dreamed of lovingly hand-crafting our own home on the Internet. We begin our quest by seeing, feeling, and harnessing pure HTML.energy.</description>

  <title>Dismal Arithmetic in Dyalog APL and Clojure</title>
  <link>https://evalapply.org/posts/dismal-arithmetic-dyalog-apl-clojure/index.html</link>

  <guid>https://evalapply.org/posts/dismal-arithmetic-dyalog-apl-clojure/</guid>
  <description>Dismal arithmetic is just like the arithmetic you learned in school, only simpler: there are no carries, when you add digits you just take the largest, and when you multiply digits you take the smallest. How does code look in the two languages I like a lot; Clojure and APL?</description>

  <description>Here lies melancholy that I put to paper from a particularly deep hole, not too long ago. It may ruin your day, or it may make you feel a little bit understood about your dark moments. Your mileage will vary.</description>

  <description>Technology is—and ought to be—the /byproduct/ of far more important, powerful, and deep-rooted aspects of organisations — including wholesale societies. The pandemic of technology-solutionism gleefully embraced and amplified by all and sundry makes me believe that people seem to have decided it's the other way around.</description>

  <description>Spurred by a conversation with a whip-smart friend and fellow gentlenerd, who unreasonably believed (believes?) they have nothing worth speaking about at the software conferences we like (IN/Clojure, FunctionalConf, local meetups etc).</description>

  <title>Technical Debt is really Software Debt. And it's a AAA-rated CDO.</title>

  <description>I've long struggled with the &lt;b&gt;Technical&lt;/b&gt; Debt metaphor. It was immediately useful when I first heard it. I still think it is useful, albeit as a starting point. The more I worked with software, the more infuriatingly incomplete it started to feel. So I've reframed it as &lt;b&gt;Software&lt;/b&gt; Debt, for myself. Here's what I'm thinking.</description>

  <description>Not a weighty meandering 300 page Zen dialogue on Motorcycle Maintenance. Merely a meandering blog post in which one contemplates &lt;em&gt;Quality&lt;/em&gt; of software products.</description>

  <description>Creating things is a delicate endeavour, fraught with peril. People struggle forward through crazy marketplace and environmental complexities just to get from one day to the other. Yet I can't shake off the feeling that we make it harder for ourselves than it should be. I've been trying to work out why. There's a lot to unpack. This post is a start at thinking about it in public.</description>

  <description>How this blog came to be is a minor miracle. Long story short, I conned myself into believing nobody will find /and/ read it. But you're here, aren't you? And you're reading this. Aren't You? Confucamus. Well, here's how you got here.</description>
