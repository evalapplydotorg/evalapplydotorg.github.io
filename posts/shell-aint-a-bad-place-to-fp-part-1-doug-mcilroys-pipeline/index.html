  <p>Things start to really heat up when it dawns on us, how a good set of standard parts can be used to express totally different ideas <em>just by composing them in different ways</em>.</p>
<p>(Edit 2022-03-10: speaking of lessons, how about the one in the appendix?!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Designing is <em>fundamentally</em> about taking things apart. It's about taking things apart <em>in such a way</em> that they can be put back together. i.e. Separating into things that can be composed."</p>
<p>— Rich Hickey, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCwqnjxqfmY">Design, Composition, and Performance</a>", 2013</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>tr -cs A-Za-z &#39;\n&#39; | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | sed 10q
</code></pre>
<p>— Douglas McIlroy, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/5948.315654">Communications of the ACM</a>, 1986</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously: <a href="https://evalapply.org/posts/shell-aint-a-bad-place-to-fp-part-0-intro/">Shell ain't a bad place to FP: part 0/N</a></p>
<h1 id="the-pipeline-that-douglas-built">The Pipeline that Douglas Built</h1>
<p>Douglas McIlroy famously (infamously?) wrote the following in reply to a problem posed by Jon Bentley for his column <em>"Programming pearls: a literate program"</em> (<em>Communications of the ACM</em> magazine, June 1986, Vol. 29, No. 6).</p>
<p>I first heard of it some years ago in <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg/">More Shell Less Egg</a>, and saw it again in the book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/classic-shell-scripting/0596005954/">Classic Shell Scripting</a> (which taught me much of my shell-fu). The original was not online then. Now I see the ACM has kindly <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/5948.315654">published it</a> along with the rest of their archives!</p>
<p>Here it is, lightly paraphrased:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code># Problem statement (word frequency):
#
# - Read a file of text
# - Determine the n most frequently-used words
# - Print out a sorted list of all the words, along with their frequencies

# Douglas McIlroy&#39;s answer

# 1. Transliterate complement (-c) of words into newlines,
# squeezing out (-s) duplicates
tr -cs A-Za-z &#39;\n&#39; |
    # 2. Transliterate uppercase to lowercase
    tr A-Z a-z |
    # 3. Sort to bring identical words together
    sort |
    # 4. Replace each run of duplicate words with
    # a single representative, and include a count
    uniq -c |
    # 5. Sort reverse (-r), numeric (-n)
    sort -rn |
    # 6. Pass through stream editor; quit after printing the
    # the first 10 lines received
    sed 10q
</code></pre>
<p>Here I am, punching the Bash manual page through it…</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>man bash |
    tr -cs A-Za-z &#39;\n&#39; | tr A-Z a-z |
    sort | uniq -c | sort -rn |
    sed 10q
</code></pre>
<p>… and here are the top 10 words by frequency.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>4200 the
1822 is
1251 to
1221 a
1147 of
 869 if
 805 and
 570 shell
 570 in
 563 command
</code></pre>
<p>"<em>Coolcoolcoolcool nodoubt nodoubt… So, uh… that's it?</em>"</p>
<h1 id="take-apart-semanticsidioms---functions">Take Apart! Semantics/Idioms -&gt; Functions</h1>
<p>It's worth observing that the <em>same</em> tools composed in <em>different</em> ways express <em>totally different</em> concepts. <code>sort</code> just sorts. <code>uniq</code> just returns uniques. <em>But</em> <code>sort | uniq</code> is an idiom for <em>set of things</em>. Whereas <code>sort | uniq -c |
  sort -rn</code> is an idiom for <em>frequency distribution</em>.</p>
<p>Now…</p>
<p>What if we use Bash functions to name the idioms we see in McIlroy's pipeline?</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>flatten_paragraphs() {
    # English-only for easy explanation, but can be more general
    tr -cs A-Za-z &#39;\n&#39;
}

tokenise_lowercase() {
    # Transliterate uppercase to lowercase
    tr A-Z a-z
}

frequencies() {
    # Produce frequency distribution of input
    sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
}

take_n() {
    # Given a number n, return those many lines of input
    # or 10 lines by default, if n is not specified.
    sed ${1:-10}q
}
</code></pre>
<p>And what if we update the pipeline with <em>function calls</em> like this?</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>man bash |
    flatten_paragraphs |
    tokenise_lowercase |
    frequencies |
    take_n 10
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, we get the same result!</p>
<pre class="text"><code>4200 the
1822 is
1251 to
1221 a
1147 of

<p>Yes, yes, <em><strong>YES</strong></em>! Functions + pipes = mind blown!</p>
<h1 id="play-semantics---functions---ooh-what-if-i">Play! Semantics -&gt; Functions -&gt; "Ooh, what if I…"</h1>
<p>Now that we lifted out a couple of text processing functions, we can try to make <em>more</em> text processing functions. Here are some examples.</p>
<p>(Edit 2022-03-10: the "clever" mkfifo-ery contains dangers I did not know of. More at the bottom, in the appendix.)</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>sort_dictionary() {
    sort -b -d -k2
}

sort_rhyme() {
    rev | sort -b -d | rev
}

# eliminate stop-words
drop_stopwords() {
    local stopwords=${1:-&quot;the,is,to,a,of,if,and,in,or,be,by,not,with,for,when,it&quot;}
    local grep_pattern=$(tr , &#39;\|&#39; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;${stopwords}&quot;)
    grep -v -E ${grep_pattern}
}

# n-grams

butlast_n() {
    # utility for picking appropriate collection of n-grams
    head -n -${1:-0}
}

bigram() {
    # we need intermediate state, but we can make it stream,
    # instead of accumulating in temp files
    mkfifo bigram_buffer

    tee &gt;(tail +2 &gt; bigram_buffer) |
        paste - bigram_buffer |
        # take all but the last entry as it is not a bigram
        butlast_n 1

    rm bigram_buffer
}

trigram() {
    # we need intermediate state, but we can make it stream,
    # instead of accumulating in temp files
    mkfifo trigram_buffer_one trigram_buffer_two

    tee &gt;(tail +2 &gt; trigram_buffer_one) |
        tee &gt;(tail +3 &gt; trigram_buffer_two) |
        paste - trigram_buffer_one trigram_buffer_two |
        # take all but the last 2 entries as they are not trigrams
        butlast_n 2

    rm trigram_buffer_one trigram_buffer_two
}
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly there is a lot to explore about functions and pipelines and other techniques in this code. We will do deep dives in upcoming posts. For now just know that Bash functions…</p>
<ul>
<li>name a group of shell statements,</li>
<li>can be composed with pipes</li>
<li>thus intermix with regular shell tools, and</li>
<li>can help create domain-specific abstractions out of domain-agnostic ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>But before we go there, indulge me and my <em>Oh, and One More Thing (TM)</em> …</p>
<h1 id="compose-again-semantics---functions---play---grand-new-pipeline">Compose Again! Semantics -&gt; Functions -&gt; Play -&gt; Grand New Pipeline</h1>
<p>What's the point of making a text processing library of functions if we don't process any text?</p>
<p>Well…</p>
<ul>
<li>Start a new shell session.</li>
<li>Copy-paste all the Bash functions above into it.</li>
<li>Then copy-paste this pipeline and</li>
<li>Hit Enter!</li>
</ul>
<pre class="shell"><code># I assume you have Bash version 4+.

<p>And why not experiment?!</p>
<p>Reorder it! Remove parts of it! Change parts of it! Give it 10 GiB of input!</p>
<p>Play and learn!!!</p>

<h1 id="addendum-remarkable-aspects-of-dougs-o.g.-pipeline">Addendum: Remarkable aspects of Doug's O.G. pipeline</h1>
<p>The UNIX tools philosophy is clearly at work. <code>sort</code> just sorts, <code>uniq</code> just returns uniques, pipes connect parts. Ho hum.</p>
<p>The things I <em>do</em> find remarkable are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Now the year is 2022, i.e. McIlroy wrote the program about 4 <em>decades</em> ago. It continues to edify, meaning the ideas it contains have a timeless quality.</p></li>
<li><p><em>It also works as-is</em>, on my cheap Thinkpad running a GNU Linux (Ubuntu), even though the original code was written for a UNIX that might live only in a museum today (or maybe in your bank). Odds look good that come 2036, it will continue to still work as-is on mainstream boxen.</p></li>
<li><p>It is plain text, and so eminently portable. (I slapped it into the org-mode file of this blog post, evaluated it via org-babel, and captured the results inline. How? Because Emacs org-babel can simply "shell out"; i.e. make a standard request to a standard shell to evaluate the program and have the shell process return any result in a standard way.)</p></li>
<li><p>I bet it runs <em>way</em> faster now because my box is a supercomputer v/s the UNIX boxen of that era.</p></li>
<li><p>Pipes remove the burden of explicit state handling. Oh, also, Douglas McIlroy invented UNIX pipes.</p></li>
<li><p>The entire composition is itself a function.</p></li>
<li><p><code>map</code> (tokenise), <code>filter</code> (uniquify), <code>reduce</code> (frequency distribution), and early termination (<code>take</code> first 10) are <em>automatic</em>, needing no special machinery.</p></li>
<li><p>It is an abstract computation that is independent of data source/sink. We can hook into any I/O combination of sockets, or fifo pipes, or files on disk without modifying the pipeline code—much like Clojure transducers or monadic I/O in Haskell land.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Most importantly</em>, a rank amateur like me could figure out each part <em>and</em> the whole in one sitting. It is eminently doable because:</p>
<ul>
<li>each sub part is understandable in isolation <em>and</em></li>
<li>the whole is amenable to incremental as well as large-scale adaptation,</li>
<li>in playful, interactive, low-risk ways.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I was clueless then and had to dig through manpages and flail about at the command line. It took me a while to grok the function of each tool and how it is applied to the text processing problem.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, I'd say bear that small cost, because it teaches a priceless lesson in modular, composable, functional architecture.</p>
<p>Plus, why not step up one's shell-fu?</p>
<h1 id="appendix-an-unexpected-masterclass">Appendix: an unexpected masterclass!</h1>
<p>My head is exploding. Prof. McIlroy emailed me some remarks. (There is a backstory, but first the important stuff.)</p>

<pre class="text"><code>(Emails redacted to stymie spambots.)

----- Original message -----
From: Douglas McIlroy &lt;Email at his web page. Link posted below.&gt;
To: Aditya Athalye &lt;Email at this web page. See footer.&gt;
Subject: Musings on your blog
Date: Wednesday, March 09, 2022 8:16 PM

Aditya,

A reader might complain that the bigram example in your blog
can be done more efficiently, with a similar amount of typing,
by a sed script instead of mkfifo, tee, and paste:

sed -n &#39;1bx; H; g; s/\n/ /p; s/.* //; :x; h&#39;

A slightly different example is immune to this charge:

trap &quot;rm -f fifo&quot; 0 HUP TERM PIPE INT
mkfifo fifo
sort |
uniq |
tee &gt;(rev | sort &gt;fifo) |
join -o 1.1 - fifo &gt;palindromes

But ... join can&#39;t move until rev|sort produces output, so
essentially the whole word list piles up in its input pipe.
If there&#39;s not enough buffer space, deadlock will occur.

The moral of this tale is that loops in the (undirected)
graph of a pipe network pose a hazard of deadlock if some
pipe queue necessarily suffers unbounded growth. This
hazard manifests in the palindrome example but not in
the bigram example.

Sidelight. Buffering by C&#39;s stdio package can cause
deadlock in a feedback loop. A process that buffers its
output will starve if it needs feedback from stuff that&#39;s
waiting in its output buffer. stdio&#39;s buffering is evil!
</code></pre>
<p>Prof. McIlroy also pointed me to his notes on coroutine-based programs (examples of stream processing in Unix).</p>
<pre class="text"><code>In case you haven&#39;t already seen it,
https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/sieve/sieve.pdf
exhibits some unusual plumbing.
</code></pre>
<p>The PDF is available at <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/">his Dartmouth College home page</a>, which has other fun stuff too.</p>
<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>I habitually cold-email people if something they did or said moved me in some constructive way. So, I wrote a little thank you note to Prof. McIlroy after posting this blog entry (nobody thinks straight at 3 AM).</p>
<p>He replied! We exchanged a couple of emails. <em>"That was <strong>so cool</strong>!"</em> thought I, and went back to life as usual.</p>
<p>Yesterday he emailed these follow-up remarks! A nice little masterclass in Unix programming that I'm so pleased to share here, with Prof. McIlroy's gracious permission.</p>
<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>
<p>Wow, this is one of the best emails I've ever received! The reader's complaints are warranted and deserved.</p>
<p>I was fooling around with mkfifo and accidentally discovered it "worked" after a fashion. "What's the buffering story?" crossed my mind, but I didn't find out. I'm also slapping my forehead for not using <code>trap</code> to auto-clean the pipes. And needless to say, <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite/blob/5f87aa0df095a1b5af914117aaa34bf63c67ec4d/shite_utils.sh#L155">my sed-fu</a> is weak. Brown belt at best :)</p>
<p>I rue the fact that I haven't paid due attention to The Machine. I can write Clojure to make a living, but can't write C to save my life :))</p>
<p>So now this excellent complaint leaves me no choice, but to crack open my long-unused copies of the K&amp;R book and The Unix Programming Environment.</p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for taking the time to teach me, Professor!</em></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Next up: Part 2/N: Deep-dive into bash functions and function design techniques</p>
<ul>
<li>Using functions to craft one’s own Bytes-sized UNIX tools</li>
<li>Using them interactively like regular UNIX tools</li>
<li>maybe more…</li>
</ul>
<p>The ol' noodle is noodlin' over it. Stay tooned!</p>
