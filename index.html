Like <em>yin/yang</em> ☯, they contain each other. And they evoke other nonduals to live by; <em>diffuse/focus</em>, <em>abstract/reify</em>, <em>design/develop</em>.<blockquote><p><strong>Stuart Feldman</strong>: If nothing else, Lisp was carefully defined in terms of Lisp.<p><strong>Alan Kay</strong>: Yes, that was the big revelation to me when I was in graduate school—when I finally understood that the half page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in itself. These were “Maxwell’s Equations of Software!” This is the whole world of programming in a few lines that I can put my hand over.</blockquote><a href=#fnref1 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn2 role=doc-endnote><p><em>Learn generously</em> is one of the self-directives at my favourite programmers' community, <em><strong>the Recurse Center</strong></em>. One stands on the shoulders of giants. One has received much generosity. One benefits greatly from contributions to the public commons. One tries to give back in one's meager ways.<div class=rc-scout></div><script async defer src="https://www.recurse-scout.com/loader.js?t=40533398b8c93bb4f3323a170e032e91"></script>

Over the last 15 years or so, I happened to market, sell, co-found, product manage, test, operate, code hire for, learn, use, teach software things. SaaS, mostly B2B, has been a core thread through all of that career vagabonding. Now, that is my wheelhouse!<a href=#fnref3 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a><li id=fn4 role=doc-endnote><p>10x implies the fact of great leverage, not the degree of it. I believe the proverbial 10x developer is that good <em>because</em> they habitually "write the thing down". I know it makes me better and I know others have profited from stuff I wrote down. Frequently years down the line. Writing is core to my process, especially as a soloist. Decision records, concept notes, checklists and runbooks, guides and tutorials, bug reports, commit messages, reviews and critiques, product documentation, blog posts, brain dump notes; I use them all judiciously in my own work.<a href=#fnref4 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></ol></section></main><footer id=site-footer><hr><div class="box invert footer stack"><p>&copy; 2024,
