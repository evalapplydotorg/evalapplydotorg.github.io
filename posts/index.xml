&lt;p>My parents are deeply systems-oriented thinkers &lt;em>and&lt;/em> doers. Biased to
thoughtful execution; whether short-or-long-range. Connoisseurs of checklists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;ve done it all, and then some, with their systems-oriented minds&amp;hellip;
Buying a car, planning a wedding, building warships, running schools and R&amp;amp;D
institutes, organizing large events, helping feed stranded migrant workers,
producing textbooks, caring for their elderly and infirm, helping their
network build lives, teaching their children independence. And I gleefully
imagine, also some top-secret classified stuff my dad can&amp;rsquo;t tell me about,
because then he would have to kill me. (Kid-me read too many spy novels :)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the big-picture level, in this household, keeping an up-to-date &amp;ldquo;death file&amp;rdquo;
is not morbid or fatalist, but a simple plan for &lt;em>after the inevitable&lt;/em>. An
act of care and kindness. At the microscopic level, I cannot recall a single
day growing up, going without a fresh hot meal on the table whether my mom was
home, or away, or sick. Together, they seemingly never missed a beat even against
steep odds, or even if one of them was failing, or was out of commission. And
here I am, barely keeping it together. Apples do fall far from trees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They never made the mistake of coddling us, but they did err by wiring us&amp;ndash;my
sibling and I&amp;ndash;with &lt;em>standards&lt;/em> for our actions and output. They failed to stop
at ethical conduct, kindness, and good manners. We had to also pay attention
to detail. Run what-if scenarios. Write things down. Be accountable to our
surroundings and the people in there. Own our successes and failures. In several
cases they had to push us (teenagers gonna teenage). In many others they led
by example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They also erred by letting us rifle through Daddy&amp;rsquo;s Awesome Cabinet of Books
and letting us borrow action-packed thrillers like &amp;ldquo;How Things Work&amp;rdquo; (Volumes 1
&lt;em>and&lt;/em> 2), and &amp;ldquo;Systems in Action&amp;rdquo;. Maybe my sibling was spared, I don&amp;rsquo;t know.
I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t. You&amp;rsquo;re a boy. And you worship your dad. And you want to be
like him. So damn straight you will devour daddy&amp;rsquo;s books. But you&amp;rsquo;re an 8th
grader, and can&amp;rsquo;t know better. To what extent that material might infiltrate
your brain. And the many ways that influence will &lt;em>mess you up&lt;/em> in adult life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be clear, I adore my parents, but I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to gloat about some superior
upbringing. Traditional societies have been bringing up their young sensitised
to cause/effect, feedback loops, and the interconnected of all things for
millennia. My chance mental conditioning merely has different set and setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nor am I advocating the merits of my superior mammalian brain. We are all
monkeys. We absorb a tremendous amount by osmosis and proximity. I simply
was (am) around them and they are a certain kind of people. So, monkey see,
monkey do, monkey programmed for life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember this for later.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Unfortunately, enterprise demise is rarely merciful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even the best systems-oriented organisations can fail through mistakes or
forces outside their control. Systems-disoriented ones, though, are almost
certain to end. The best case end-state is a mercifully swift death. The
worst case is akin to eternal hell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is easy to spot hellish organisations. They are ones who mistook bureaucracy
for systems. They erect tall barb-wire fences of paperwork and procedure (and
of actual barb-wire, too, come to think of it). They make Byzantine mazes of
confounding rules and approvals. Elaborate rituals with no memory of why.
Their customers puzzle through the madness. Their staff dutifully tend to these,
because that&amp;rsquo;s what procedure, fences, and mazes are for, after all; to be
tended to, ritually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, bureaucracies frequently succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bureaucracies are the ones that successfully pulled off the reality-escape
magic trick of turning into axiomatic self-perpetuating ever-expanding entities.
And they are frequently pathological. They exist because they exist. They make
rules because they make rules. They don&amp;rsquo;t grow, they metastasise. Vogons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, systems people look like bureaucrats at first glance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is often hard to understand, or indeed believe, what these so-called systems
people are going on about. They appear to be infuriatingly reluctant to
&lt;em>just do&lt;/em> stuff. They want us to think of this and that and the other thing.
They ask too many questions. They engage in that perversion of holism which
our education weaned us off long ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, consummate bureaucrats are camouflage experts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They don the colours of systems-builders (it makes for great press, and randomly
it can actually become true through no fault of said consummate bureaucrat).
But really it is all in service of the pathological bureaucracy that kowtows
the whims of some great dictator high above. The consummate &lt;strong>and&lt;/strong> competent
bureaucrat is an endangered animal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How, pray tell, is the hapless commoner to discern the master of Machiavellian
machinations, from the grappler of vexing problems of far-reaching import?
One who sees through the Eye of Sauron versus one who has vision? One who is
capable of thinking &lt;strong>and&lt;/strong> of creating?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When suddenly confronted with an alive, organic whole wrought of systems
harmonised of systems, we can be forgiven for getting lost in a single detail
amidst infinite splendour. Like Arthur Dent trying to comprehend the copy of
Earth suspended before him, and finally finding succour in a familiar cup of
tea in his own replicated home. &amp;ldquo;Amazed and lost&amp;rdquo; is quite unlike &amp;ldquo;lost in a
maze&amp;rdquo;. The systems-builder, meanwhile, looks on with kind empathy for our
sudden loss of tongue. Silently joyous about what was realized through them.
Slartibartfast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Vogon&amp;rsquo;s employer and A Slartibartfast&amp;rsquo;s employer both produce and perpetuate
grand structures, intricately patterned, with unfathomable puzzles and games
of life that could keep us occupied forever, and perhaps even drive us to
insanity. Yet one is a simulacrum of the other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets just say that if I were fated to go stark raving mad, and I had to choose
between these opposite archetypes, I&amp;rsquo;d rather lose my mind working for a
Slartibartfast. And if you find yourself under a Vogon&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do Panic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Scale&lt;/em> is where it&amp;rsquo;s at, these days. It so obviously &lt;em>right&lt;/em> to &lt;em>want&lt;/em> to
&lt;em>scale&lt;/em> all the things all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try to loudly diss &amp;ldquo;scaling&amp;rdquo;. See if you don&amp;rsquo;t get funny looks and wry remarks
about &amp;ldquo;lifestyle business&amp;rdquo; or something appropriately classifying. Luckily,
that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do today. Also this is the last time fish,
reptiles, dermatology, or the insides of boilers will appear in this piece.
Business thinks of scaling as growing bigger &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->and&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> doing so faster. And we
mean business here, okay?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we&amp;rsquo;re in a spot of trouble, aren&amp;rsquo;t we? The word &lt;em>fucked&lt;/em> comes to mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Systems&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;complexity&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;perspective&amp;rdquo; feel like dirty epithets in polite
(board)rooms (or indeed, most rooms). And heaven forfend if you&amp;rsquo;re an engineer
given to worrying about such stuff. (Engineers can actually verify their
Enterprise F-word Factor real quick. Use those words in your next executive
meeting, and closely watch superior eyes. If they light up, count your lucky
stars.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet people know deep down, that such things really exist, that they matter,
that we are part of the equation. But even if everyone cares, where is the
time or incentive to ferret out their presence in our organisations, much less
map out and observe their mechanics? We&amp;rsquo;re so focused and &lt;em>busy&lt;/em> pushing the
numbers that denote scaling for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, people have an intuitive feel for the aggregate effect of their
scaling efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This &amp;ldquo;effective scaling effect&amp;rdquo;, for lack of better words, is measurable in
gut-feels, and I bet, also as hard numbers in terms of &lt;strong>net resources expended&lt;/strong>
&lt;strong>to convert net inputs into net outputs&lt;/strong>. Such a &lt;em>lens of net effect&lt;/em> would
abstract over systems thinking mechanics of flows, feedback loops, buffers,
controls, and relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following picture is not meant to capture system dynamics, but to think
about net effects of system dynamics&amp;hellip; a sort of contrast material to compare
one&amp;rsquo;s current trajectory.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I worry for us, you know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our great civilization-scale hustle, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost the greater (systemic)
perspective. Perspective crucial to the control and management of giant grizzly
bears of self-made complexity. Everything seems to be on fire at all scales,
but we all seem to feel&amp;hellip; fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe I just have a morbid eye. Please tell me I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="example-what-s-cooler-than-10-bn-100-bn-dot">Example: What&amp;rsquo;s cooler than 10 Bn? 100 Bn.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The way tech startups function in India drives me to despair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think founders and staff lose a tremendous amount of value to avoidable chaos,
needless complexity, excessive cargo-culting of tech and business ideas, severe
under-investment in human capacity-building, and quite frankly rather poor
attention to detail. One can very well count their true burn rate not in dollar
terms, but in minds wasted, and bodies spent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Operating in India is ridiculously hard as it is, and founders must struggle
forward through crazy marketplace/environmental complexities. I think those
other factors I stated previously compound to make things far worse that they
need to be. It&amp;rsquo;s like death by a thousand cuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, people look at me funny when I say I think that the poster-child
sale of Flipkart to Walmart was a tragedy. To me, that was a $100 Bn company
(or bigger!) that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Anecdotally, I believe many similar tragedies
are in progress as we speak. Value erosion of a colossal scale. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m
too much of an idealist? Or worse, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m too much of an engineer? What
could I &lt;em>possibly&lt;/em> know about things way above my pay grade?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately for me, I can&amp;rsquo;t help thinking there must be a better way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tying-it-together-dot-trying-it-together">Tying it together. Trying it together?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Software &lt;em>is&lt;/em> extreme leverage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Transmuting real-world idioms and processes into bits and API calls is literally
game-changing. This we know to be true to experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, any enormously high-leverage intervention routinely produces every
conceivable externality, positive or negative or just&amp;hellip; alien. So often,
we don&amp;rsquo;t even know what we&amp;rsquo;re really looking at. &lt;em>New&lt;/em>. &lt;em>NFT&lt;/em>. &lt;em>WTF&lt;/em>. &lt;em>Wow&lt;/em>.
That&amp;rsquo;s what you get when a model in a computer can thumb its nose at the laws
of Physics. Crazy variance of outcome. Power law inversions of control away
from the world of brick and mortar and atoms and societies into power-centers
capable of planet-scale rearrangement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People don&amp;rsquo;t scale, systems do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scaling begets complexity. Systems create leverage. Systems-oriented people
create ways to thrive in complex worlds. Organisations that invest deeply in
systems-oriented people have a shot at greatness at scale. Those that don&amp;rsquo;t,
risk unchecked destruction of value for self and ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;s a muscle to
build. It takes persistent work. You need the stomach for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, you will likely build a bureaucracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And build it fast. Actually, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; one, you just have
to do nothing and let it manifest itself. Easy-peasy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose you suddenly learn that you are now a founder hustlin' a red-hot tech
startup, and suddenly find yourself in possession of gobs of money, and honestly
not much leadership experience, you may very quickly also find yourself in
possession of small armies of people. The pressure to &amp;ldquo;grow&amp;rdquo; will be immense.
So will be the weight of responsibility. You may feel trapped, your only recourse
being to open wide and swallow as much as you can as fast as you can. You will
make the cardinal mistake of adding more people to your already late launch.
And when it&amp;rsquo;s all threatening to go sideways, you will discover your inner
Great Dictator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will be tempting. You feel the hurt, but you also feel the power. You tell
yourself it will somehow all work out in the end. That growth will forgive all
sins. It won&amp;rsquo;t. Resist the urge to command and control. Resist becoming a Vogon.
Resist the slippery slope to the hell of pathological bureaucracies. Strive
to be a Slartibartfast. A creative, generative leader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Power over rules is real power.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;If you want to understand the deepest malfunctions of systems, pay attention
to the rules and to who has power over them.&amp;quot;&lt;/em> - Donella Meadows, Thinking in
Systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are all monkeys, remember? You may be the top dog, but I be you watch your
authority figures. Just as your people watch you. What are you absorbing?
What are you disseminating?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are also &lt;em>in&lt;/em> the system. You are bound by its laws, even if you created
it. Especially if you created it. But if you created it, you may have power
to change the rules. You may even have the greatest power; the power to
set/reset its goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How will you wield your power?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Confucamus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, here&amp;rsquo;s how you got here.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>You see, I&amp;rsquo;ve been&amp;hellip; was&amp;hellip; e-sober for a measurable fraction of the
Internet era.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been over ten years since I took down my last (and first) blog. Eight
since I nuked my FB with extreme prejudice, discovering in the bargain a fine
capacity for smug satisfaction, when the chagrin of aghast friends and sundry
affected me not one whit. Nary a tweet-song has erupted, five years and
counting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The WWW had gotten A Bit Too Much. I wanted to say nothin' to nobody on it.
I was content writing the occasional long email to friends and randoms.
I was &lt;em>fine&lt;/em>. &lt;em>Everything was.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mother nature, though. She tests us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Predictably, she sprung A Rather Big Surprise at the least-convenient moment
in the least-convenient century (for me, at any rate).
That-which-shall-not-be-named imposed a period of involuntary house arrest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was then, in that long dark tea time of the soul, will weakened, that I
snagged a domain on impulse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This very domain. Just for my email, mind you. To de-google myself. Or something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, how little did I know. &lt;a href="http://garann.com/dev/2013/how-to-blog-about-code-and-give-zero-fucks/">Insidious&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">thoughts&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/09/journaling/">started&lt;/a> invading my consciousness
through my soothingly red-shifted displays. The Feature Creep crept up slowly,
subtly erecting neon hoardings to subvert the fog my mind had gladly embraced.
&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Does your domain apologetically redirect to your github?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em>
&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Your site can be more. Do more. So much more.&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em>
&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;If a reader fell upon this site and no form was around to comment in,
did they make a sound?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em>
Foggy the mind was, yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s when it gripped me. The desire to write. And it started gnawing away
inside. It was all The Feature Creep&amp;rsquo;s doing, of course, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know
it then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, my terror of looking like an idiot&amp;ndash;nay, an &lt;em>impostor&lt;/em>&amp;ndash;was far more
potent than The FC&amp;rsquo;s gnawing at my anemic will. I narrowly avoided working up
the nerve to just point the damn domain to Wordpress and slam publish like it
was 2005 again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Days turned to weeks. Weeks glommed into months. Some uncalled for hair loss
occurred and a year passed. Meanwhile, the domain redirected reliably,
unaware of the mayhem within and without.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still The FC gnawed on. The Feature Creep never tires, never lies down, and
never dies, you see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slyly (or so I thought), I fooled it by quietly typing into my Emacs. More
days turned to weeks turned to months. Words accreted in my org-mode files.
Wee notes. Snippets. Factoids squirreled away. Mostly harmless bits and bobs.
Someone paying attention might have smelled trouble brewing and stopped right
there. But, oh how little did I know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unwittingly, I started penning lofty thoughts too. I caught on soon enough,
but I kept doing it, despite now being acutely aware that I&amp;rsquo;d wake up feeling
dirty the morning after. My confidence, though. My, did it grow supreme. It
took perverse delight in jotting down opinions way above my pay grade because,
after all, nobody would find out. It was all on my computer. Even if I
didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>shred&lt;/em> it all, bitrot would certainly destroy every last trace of
my misadventures. And I&amp;rsquo;d safely take my little secret life to my grave.
Yes, I&amp;rsquo;d get away with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then my partner found out and started telling me things, whispering words
of encouragement (somehow, &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;egged on&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> seems more apt).
The fault is all mine though; why we&amp;rsquo;re here. For shortly after, in a
momentary lapse of judgment, I also told a friend.
And then, fatally, I failed to continue keeping mum before other friends.
Now they want to read it all, and not privately, but &amp;ldquo;on your bloody blog,
dummy&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s when I &lt;em>knew&lt;/em>. The Feature Creep had me dead to rights
from the get go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The obvious moral here is if you want to continue &lt;em>not&lt;/em> writing on the WWW,
don&amp;rsquo;t under &lt;em>any&lt;/em> circumstance impulse-purchase that domain, and if you do,
don&amp;rsquo;t secretly type in your computer, and if you do, for the love of your Gods,
don&amp;rsquo;t wed or befriend anyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow, it was too late for me. Feeling suitably cornered and wretched,
much moping around ensued, until it hit me; &amp;ldquo;Wait a minute, I &lt;em>am&lt;/em> an idiot,
but I also &lt;em>want&lt;/em> to be &lt;a href="https://danluu.com/look-stupid/">less of one&lt;/a>.&amp;rdquo;
So this is&amp;hellip; also fine. Maybe they will even tell me HowTo Not Idiot, if
they&amp;rsquo;re still here, reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I submitted. That domain I impulse-bought stopped redirecting, pointing
to this instead. Then with infinite improbability, your browser pointed to
that and served this up. And now you know exactly how you got here. And&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re still reading, aren&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your readership graces this site. To me, writing was thinking. Apparently it
can also be a process of becoming. So thank you for being here (bows deeply).
Several word collections are in progress. Please stay as long as you wish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll pause here to doff my hat to some heroes that I draw inspiration from;

and a hundred more&amp;hellip; Much to learn, have I.
But we here now, an' we gon' try. We gon' try, to eval/apply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be some technical words, some code play, some HowTos, some WhyTos,
pondering-upons of some real doozies like &amp;ldquo;Systems, Scale, Value&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;Technical Debt is a CDO&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Envelope of control&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Why was the misbehaving
system behaving itself?&amp;rdquo; and so forth. No pundering at all, if you&amp;rsquo;re
wondering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enroute, maybe your eye catches something iffy and twitches. Perhaps a whiff
of bull causes your nostrils to flare slightly. Maybe something really gets
your goose and your brain screams &amp;ldquo;NO. Don&amp;rsquo;t. Type. You &lt;strong>promised&lt;/strong> you&amp;rsquo;re
done with these Internet randos who are SO BLOODY WRONG.&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m helping you by not having a comment form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I&amp;rsquo;ll be delighted to hear from you at &lt;em>weblog (at) evalapply (dot) org&lt;/em>
if it strikes your fancy! (Or &lt;em>youresobloodywrong (at) evalapply (dot) org&lt;/em>
if it&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>that&lt;/em> kind of a day and you can&amp;rsquo;t stand it any more.
I know the feeling. I&amp;rsquo;m here, listening :).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you for swinging by!&lt;/p>
