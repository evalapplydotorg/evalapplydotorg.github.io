Accumulated baggage is being tagged for eventual garbage collection. The mind's mechanics are being revised. The body is being repaired and upgraded. New experiences are being opted into. By learning to see with new eyes, a fresh vision of self, world, and life is appearing.<blockquote><p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Adopt "diffuse mode" mindset to reinvent, and "focus mode" mindset to then re-build.</blockquote><p><strong>2023 is professional reinvention number three.</strong><p>My 20s were full of MBA-type work as well as one failed attempt at a startup. My 30s became about software engineering. This fourth decade seems to have begun with yet another pivot; toward solo enterprise. Suit and hoodie are amalgamating.<blockquote><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Test one's wits, skills, capabilities, knowledge in the exacting crucible of makin' and sellin' stuff.</blockquote><p><strong>2023 is sabbatical number four.</strong><p>My sabbaticals have been times of hardcore reading, study, and hands-on use of new knowledge. Literally living <em>eval/apply</em>; I learn things and test myself by landing paid gigs for what I have learned. Let's see where this one goes.<blockquote><p><strong>Insight:</strong> Making sabbaticals work is primarily about psychology, not money.</blockquote><p><strong>Yes, and…</strong><p>An improv-style approach is being applied to break into the present, and to also break out of the "no, but" style psychological ossification that is common experience, after having lived a bit <em>but</em> not quite enough (but not too much either, which engenders a "like, whatever" style of psychological regression. If you call this improv-ing oneself, I won't complain.<blockquote><p><strong>Experience:</strong> I am about a year into what I've dubbed the "<em>Yes, and</em> method of reinvention". And yes, I heartily recommend it to anyone who will listen.</blockquote><p><strong>Small is beautiful; the lifelong trend continues.</strong><p>Career-start was the first time I truly exerted my volitional muscles, and chose to work with/at small and medium companies instead of the socially approved giant MNC circuit. That drive has run through my MBA twenties, tech thirties, and seems to be the <em>telos</em> for the, shall we say, <em><a href=https://goodreads.com/book/show/37570605-company-of-one>company of one</a></em> forties?<blockquote><p><strong>Principle:</strong> When reinventing, known-good legacy need not be discarded. It may in fact be the very thing to subtract down to, and rebuild from, anew.</blockquote><p><strong>2021 and 2022</strong><blockquote><p>"A rebirth requires a death."<p>— Yours truly</blockquote><p>'nuff said.<p><strong>2020</strong><p><em>This</em> would be <em>The Year Of Total Reinvention</em>, had Certain World Events not intervened. Still, it began swimmingly, hacking Clojure code at a consulting gig, organising <a href=https://inclojure.org/>IN/Clojure 2020</a>, and experiencing an amazing programmer's retreat at the <a href=https://recurse.com>Recurse Center</a>.<p><strong>Pre-2020</strong><p>Faded into the mists of time. <a href=#what-i-am-doing-now>GOTO now</a>.</main><footer id=site-footer><hr><div class="box invert footer stack"><p>&copy; 2023,
